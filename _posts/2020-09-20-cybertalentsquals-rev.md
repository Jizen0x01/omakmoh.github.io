It is an .apk file .. you can download the apk from [here](https://hubchallenges.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Reverse/isolation.apk) <br>


First of all i install the apk file on genymotion emulator and run it <br>

When i open the application i see login page but without login button

this is the thing which mentioned in the description 

Then I realized that there is another page i will access it from outside the application and this issue called access control issue

first thing came in my mind it's decode the apk file

I decode the app using apktool `apktool d isolate.apk`

Then i inspect AndroidManiFest.XML looking for any activities

As we see there is an Activity called `SECRETBOX` and it is protected with an intent filter 
and the intent filter should not use it as a protection mechanism because when using the intent filter whe an app component like activity the component is publicly exported , so the activity is vulenrable and it can be invoke from any outside application

So let's make some fun 

via adb shell i use this command `am start -W com.cybertalents.otherside/.SecretBox`

and finally we made it..
